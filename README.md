# Bargain Bites

**Bargain Bites** is a mobile application supported in Android and iOS, designed to address the critical issue of food waste in Canada.

This initiative not only benefits the environment by reducing carbon emissions but also supports smaller retailers and provides consumers with affordable grocery options.
