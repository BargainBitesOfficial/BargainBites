# Bargain Bites

## Introduction
**Bargain Bites** is a mobile application designed to address the critical issue of food waste in Canada. By identifying and promoting near-expired products, we provide consumers with real-time information on discounted items, helping to reduce waste and recover costs for retailers. This initiative not only benefits the environment by reducing carbon emissions but also supports smaller retailers and provides consumers with affordable grocery options.
